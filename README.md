## **Project Motivation**
As we near the completion of our academic journey, our curiosity about the job market, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence, has increased. Motivated by a desire to gain deeper analytical skills and understanding, we chose this dataset as our focus!ðŸš€

## **Project Overview**
This project explores the impact of AI and automation on employment across various industries by analyzing job listings. The dataset, derived from Kaggle, includes 500 job listings with attributes such as job titles, industry types, company sizes, locations, AI adoption levels, automation risks, required skills, salary in USD, remote work compatibility, and job growth projections.

## **About The Dataset**
**AI-Powered Job Market Insights** offers a synthetic glimpse into how AI and automation impact the job market across various industries. This dataset includes 500 job listings with details on job roles, AI adoption, and automation risks, ideal for exploring employment trends and the future impact of technology.

## **Objectives**
- **Classification:** Utilize machine learning techniques to categorize job roles based on AI adoption into three classes: low, medium, and high. This will help in identifying which job roles are incorporating AI the most.
  
- **Clustering:** Analyze automation risks across industries to identify which sectors are most vulnerable to job displacement due to automation, as well as those that are more resilient.
  
- **Data Analysis:** Investigate the influence of AI and automation on salary ranges, skill requirements, and job growth projections to provide a comprehensive view of the future job market.
Methods Used
