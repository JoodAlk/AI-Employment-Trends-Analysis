First, classification techniques will be employed to group job roles based on their level of AI adoption (e.g., low, medium, high), helping to reveal trends in which types of jobs are embracing AI the most. Second, clustering methods will assess automation risks across industries, identifying sectors most vulnerable to automation. By analyzing the automation risk across sectors, the study will highlight which industries are more prone to job displacement due to automation, as well as which ones are more resilient.\n\nThis analysis, using 500 job listings, will also examine the impact on salaries, required skills, and job growth projections, providing a well-rounded view of the future job market. The class label in this dataset is the 'Job_Growth_Projection', which categorizes job roles as either experiencing \"Growth\" or \"Decline\" or \"Stable\". This label represents the expected future trend for each job role and industry, allowing us to analyze which roles are likely to expand or shrink in the coming years.",
